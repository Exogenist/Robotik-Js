# Sort Function

A collection of two sort methods for sorting numerical arrays. The first contained in sort.js is a light weight sort function similar in respect to the bubble sort algorithm. The second, recursivesort.js uses conditional paths to sort the array. 
 
## Code Example

By using either code in sort.js or recursivesort.js define an array then call the array in the function and the console will output the ordered array.

example
```JavaScript
var arr = [3, 2, 1];
sort(arr); //output: [1, 2, 3]
```

## Motivation

Of the two sort methods introduced the one contained in sort.js is capable of dealing with large data sets in a faster time. It is compared with two other sort methods, insertion and the built in sort method. When compared it is faster than both and performs better with larger data sets. This can be seen in the performance folder. For quick sorting this function can prove handy when performance is an issue or large data is being analyzed.

The second method, introduced in recursivesort.js, when compared it performs worse than all the sort methods. However it uses a "path" technique which is useful in some situations.
