# Essential Algorithms in Javascript
Robotik.js is a library which contains many solutions that make the coding process automnous . There are two main sets of code. Those developed through the freecodecamp challenges https //www.freecodecamp.com and those I've picked up in different places. Both sets contain functions useful for the problem solving process. 

### Motivation
Algorithms are highly useful for autonomous solutions to problems. This is my attempt to organize useful algorithms in JavaScript for easy and useful access. The algorithms produced from freecodecamp.com (FCC) algorithm challenges are necessary for qualification as a frontend web developer.    

All other algorithms were developped for differing reasons.
