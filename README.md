# Various Algorithms in Javascript
A journal of all the algorithms I've come across  There are two main sets. Those developed through the freecodecamp challenges https //www.freecodecamp.com and those I've picked up in different places. 

### Motivation
Algorithms are highly useful for autonomous solutions to problems. This is my attempt to organize useful algorithms in JavaScript for easy and useful access. The algorithms produced from freecodecamp.com (FCC) algorithm challenges are necessary for qualification as a frontend web developer.
