# Algorithms
A library of all my algorithms. There are two sets of code. Those developed through the freecodecamp challenges and those developed as solutions to problems in various projects. 

The code in the main algorithms folder are solutions to problems in a real world setting. They contain investigatory code like the performance between different types of sort functions and pragmatic code like making a html div act responsively based on viewport height and width. As such the library can seem disjoint or lacking of any cohesive agenda. It's better to view this repository, for now, as some sort of dictionary for various algorithms. In the near future I hope to compile all of these code into a JavaScript library.

### Motivation
Have you ever been in the situation where you happen upon a problem whose solution you forgot sometime ago. Its a frustrating feeling to have to resolve what was already solved. Furthermore it's a massive misuse of resources. Precious time could be spent on the core problem. This repository aims to collect many of these solutions into one place for easy access and configuration in the hopes of making the development process in little less painful.

### Contributions
Please feel free to contribute or get in contact if you would like to see any algorithms added to this repository. The more the better. 

### TO DO: 
1. Organize [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) solutions to basic and intermediate algorithms
2. Add README.md to relevant places
3. Organize main-algorithms file structure
4. Add to main-algorithms uncommitted solutions
